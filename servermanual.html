			<!-- Jamulus server requirements -->
			<h2>Jamulus server requirements</h2>
			<h4>Internet connection</h4>
			<p>The minimum internet connection speed for the server is 1 Mbps
				for up- and downstream and a very low ping time.
			</p>
			<h4>Computer hardware</h4>
			<p>It is recommended to have at least 1.6 GHz CPU frequency and 1 GB
				RAM.
			</p>
			<h4>Operating system</h4>
			<p>The Jamulus server can be run on all supported operating systems
				(Windows, Mac and Linux).
			</p>

			<!-- Using Windows OS -->
			<h2>Using Windows OS</h2>
			<p>After installing Jamulus you find a link to the server in the Windows
				start menu (or "All apps" under Windows 8). When starting the server it
				automatically registers at the official central server. Just type in the
				name, city and country so that other users can easily identify your server.</p>
			<p>If you want the server to be started automatically on each Windows
				start, enable the corresponding check box. If you do not want to register
				your server at the official central server (so that it does not show up in the
				server list of jamulus.dyndns.org) uncheck the "Register" check box.</p>

			<!-- Using a Linux shell -->
			<h2>Using a Linux shell</h2>
			<p>If the server shall be started from within an ssh shell, there is
				a command line option
			</p>
			<p><i>./Jamulus -s -n</i>
			</p>
			<p>available which starts the server without a GUI (even though the
				GUI is not used, QT must still be installed on the server to run the
				Jamulus server software).
			</p>

			<!-- NAT -->
			<h2>Operating a central Jamulus server behind a NAT (network router)</h2>
			<p><i>Note that the following instruction must not be done if you
					register your server at the official jamulus central server since in that case
					the NAT port is opened automatically.</i></p>
			<p>If a Jamulus <b>central</b> server is operated behind a NAT (network router), a
				port forwarding to the computer running the Jamulus server software
				has to be setup in the router. The default port for the current
				version of the Jamulus software is 22124.
			</p>
			<p>You have to open your firewall for the <b>UDP</b> (not TCP) protocol for the port
				you run Jamulus server with.
			</p>
			<p>E.g., for a Linksys router, this setting can be found in the
				following settings dialog:
			</p>
			<p><img src="images/Linksysportforwarding.jpg" name="Linksysportforwarding" alt="Linksys port forwarding" align="bottom" width="400" height="197" border="0" />
			</p>
			<p>See also <a href="http://www.portforward.com/">portforward.com</a>.
			</p>
			<p>You do not need to open a port range as shown in the example
				above as long as you want to start only one instance of the Jamulus
				server on the same machine.
			</p>
			<p>When using a different port than the default port of Jamulus server
				(22124) you have to enter the port number after the server name or
				ip address separated by a colon in the Jamulus client (e. g.
				jamulus.dyndns.org<b>:22120</b>).
			</p>

			<!-- jamulus.dyndns.org configuration -->
			<h2><span class="red">Outdated:</span> Configuration of the jamulus.dyndns.org official central server</h2>
			<h4>Starting the server</h4>
			<p>The official central server at jamulus.dyndns.org is started with the following
				command line:
			</p>
			<pre>chrt 99 ionice -c1 nice -n -20 Jamulus -s -n -g
	-l /var/log/llconserver1 -e "localhost" -o "jamulus.dyndns.org;Aachen;82" &amp;</pre>
			<ul>
				<li>chrt 99: run a new process with
					the given real-time scheduling properties</li>
				<li>ionice -c1: sets the io
					scheduling class to 1 for real time</li>
				<li>nice -n -20: run with modified
					scheduling priority -20 (highest priority)</li>
				<li>-s: Jamulus server mode</li>
				<li>-n: the server shall be run in deamon mode and no GUI is started</li>
				<li>-g: send ping messages to the servers in the server list to keep NAT ports open</li>
				<li>-l /var/log/llconserver1: store
					the server statistic in the file llconserver1</li>
				<li>-e: central server address (since this is a central server, set to "localhost")</li>
				<li>-o: set the name, city and country information</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Html current server status page</h4>
			<p>With the "-m" and "-a" command line arguments a server statistic information can
				be generated to be put on a web page. An example php script for using the server
				status file for displaying the current server status on a html page (assuming
				the following command line arguments to be used: "-m /var/www/stat1.dat -a jamulus.dyndns.org") is:
			</p>
			<pre>&lt;?php
function loadserverstat ( $statfilename )
{
   $datei = fopen ( $statfilename, &quot;r&quot; );
   while (&nbsp;!feof ( $datei ) )
   {
	  $buffer = fgets ( $datei, 4096 );
	  echo $buffer;
   }
   fclose($datei);
}
?&gt;
&lt;?php loadserverstat ( &quot;stat1.dat&quot; );&nbsp;?&gt;</pre>
